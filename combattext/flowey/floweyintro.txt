See that heart?
That is your SOUL,~the very culmination~of your being!
Your SOUL starts off~weak, but can grow~strong if you gain a~lot of LV.
What does LV stand~for?
Why, LOVE, of course!
You want some LOVE,~don't you?
Don't worry!
I'll share some~with you!
Down here, LOVE is~spread through...
Little white...
"friendliness~pellets!"
Are you ready?
Move around and get~as many as you can!
