Oh dear, that took longer than I thought it would.
How did you get here, my child? Are you hurt?
There, there, I will heal you.
I should not have left you alone for so long.
It was irresponsible to try to surprise you like this.
Err...
Well, I suppose I cannot hide it any longer.
Come, small one!
