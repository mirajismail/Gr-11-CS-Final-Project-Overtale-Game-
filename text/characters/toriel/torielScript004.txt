As a human living in the UNDERGROUND, monsters may attack.
You will need to be prepared for this situation.
However, worry not! The process is simple!
When you encounter a monster, you will enter a fight.
While you are in a fight, strike up a friendly conversation.
Stall for time. I will come to resolve the conflict.
Practice talking to the dummy.
oh WAIT!!!!!!!
THATS NOT A DUMMY!!!!
SAVE ME HUMAN!!!
