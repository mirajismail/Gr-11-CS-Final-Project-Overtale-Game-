You have done excellently thus far, my child.
However... I have a difficult request to ask of you.
...
I would like you to walk to the end of the room by yourself.
Forgive me for this.
Greetings, my child. Do not worry, I did not leave you.
I was mererly behind this pillar the whole time.
Thank you for trusting me.
However, there was an important reason for this exercise.
... to test your independence.
I must attend to some business, and you must stay alone for a while.
Please remain here. 
It's dangerous to explore by yourself.
I have an idea. I will give you a CELL PHONE.
If you have need for anything, just call.
Be good? alright?
