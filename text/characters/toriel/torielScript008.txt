Hello?
I Just realized that it has been a while since I have cleaned up.
I was not expecting to have company so soon.
There are probably a lot of things lying about here and there.
You can pick them up, but do not carry more than you need.
Someday you might see something you really like. 
You wil want to leave room in your pockets for that.
